# GNURadio Transmitter and Receiver Example Flowgraph for BladeRF (gr-osmosdr)

This repository hosts an example GNURadio flowgraph tailored for users of the BladeRF hardware with `gr-osmosdr` support. The flowgraph provides a basic but comprehensive template for setting up a software-defined radio (SDR) environment capable of both transmitting and receiving radio signals.

## Description

The flowgraph included in this repository serves as a starting point for SDR enthusiasts and researchers who wish to explore the capabilities of the BladeRF platform using GNURadio. It is designed to be modular and easily adaptable for a wide range of radio frequency experiments and applications.

### Features

- **Transmitter Example**: A simple transmitter flowgraph demonstrates how to generate and send signals using the BladeRF.
- **Receiver Example**: Complementary to the transmitter, the receiver flowgraph is set up to capture and process incoming radio signals.
- **gr-osmosdr Integration**: Utilizes the `gr-osmosdr` block for seamless interaction with the BladeRF hardware, ensuring broad compatibility and ease of use.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust frequencies, gains, and other parameters to suit their specific needs.
- **Test Files Preparation**: A setup script is included to generate test data, ensuring users can validate the flowgraph functionality immediately.

### Applications

The example flowgraphs can be utilized for educational purposes, hobbyist projects, or as a foundation for more complex SDR development tasks. They are ideal for anyone looking to get started with RF transmission and reception using the BladeRF and GNURadio.

### Getting Started

Clone the repository, run the setup script to create necessary data files, and launch GNURadio Companion to open and execute the flowgraph examples. Users can modify the examples as needed to fit their project requirements.

Whether you are a student learning the basics of radio communication, a hobbyist looking to experiment with new modulations, or a developer prototyping a wireless system, this example flowgraph is the perfect starting point for your journey with BladeRF and GNURadio.
